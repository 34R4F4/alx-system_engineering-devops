<h2>Background Context</h2>

<p><a href="/rltoken/a83_NOBEtXgFr1Yqej0HYA" title="CMD CHALLENGE" target="_blank">CMD CHALLENGE</a> is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. It’s a good training to improve your command line skills!</p>

<p><strong>This project is NOT mandatory</strong> at all. It is 100% optional. Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won’t get hurt if you don’t do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li>A <code>README.md</code> file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory</li>
<li>This project will be manually reviewed.</li>
<li>As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green</li>
<li>Create a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels</li>
<li>Push this screenshot with the right name to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specific</h3>

<p>In addition to completing the project tasks and submitting the required <code>screenshots</code> to <code>GitHub</code>, you are also required to demonstrate the use of the <code>SFTP</code> (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move your local screenshots to the sandbox environment.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Here are the steps to follow:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Take the <code>screenshots</code> of the completed levels as mentioned in the <code>general</code> requirements.</li>
<li>Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.</li>
<li>Use the <code>SFTP command-line tool</code> to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the <code>hostname</code>, <code>username</code>, and <code>password</code> provided to you for the sandbox environment.</li>
<li>Once connected, navigate to the <code>directory</code> where you want to upload the <code>screenshots</code>.</li>

<li>Once the <code>screenshots</code> are transferred, you can proceed to push the <code>screenshots</code> to <code>GitHub</code> as mentioned in the initial requirements.</li>
<li>Make sure to include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your project’s README.md file. This will help the reviewers understand how you performed the file transfer using SFTP.</li>
</ul>
